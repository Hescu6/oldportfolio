	<h1>HILDEBRANDO ESCUDERO</h1>
	<h3>COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENT</h3>
	<p id="prgrph">I'm a Computer Science undergrad student at The University of the District of 
	   Columbia. As I seek to continue my growth as a programmer/computer engineer,
	   I would like to start gaining experience and knowledge from professionals in 
	   the field. With my knowledge and fervor towards technology, I am confident that
	   I will quickly outstrip my current self in the tech industry.
	</p>
	
	<h3 id="exception2";> <img src="blackboard.png" alt="CourseWork";>
	Course Work </h3>
	
	<p id="prgrph2">
	Being in my Junior year of undergrad school, I have taken many courses that have helped
	me better understand different aspects of computing. I have worked with C++ since i was a 
	teenager, but it wasn't until I learned about data structures, algorithms, and logic design, 
	that I fully understood the inmense capabilities programming has. I have also learned to
	program in Java and Python, and I'm currently taking classes regarding computer/code
	organization, cloud computing, and web development through HTML/CSS.
	</p>
